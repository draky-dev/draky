# Intro

draky is an easy to use local development tool for managing environments that's designed to make
them as transparent and customizable as possible. The tool was made to make direct work with docker
easier, instead of hiding environment configuration behind opaque layers of abstraction.

Documentation is available at [https://draky.dev](https://draky.dev).

# Requirements:
- bash
- docker
